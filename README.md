Ransomware Detection and Prevention using Random Forest (ML)
A machine learning-based system for detecting and preventing ransomware attacks using the Random Forest algorithm. 
This project leverages Python and various libraries to analyze system behavior, classify files/processes, and take preventive action against potential ransomware threats.

🚀 Features
Ransomware Detection:
Utilizes a trained Random Forest model to identify ransomware activity based on system and file behavior.

Real-Time Monitoring:
Continuously monitors directories and processes for suspicious activity.

Prevention Mechanism:
Automatically takes action (e.g., process termination, file quarantine) when ransomware is detected.

Extensible & Modular:
Organized codebase with separate modules for data handling, model training, monitoring, simulation, and utilities.

🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/lakshay5928/Ransomware-Detection-and-Prevention-using-Random-Forest-ML-.git
cd Ransomware-Detection-and-Prevention-using-Random-Forest-ML-

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create requirements.txt if not present, listing all required packages like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.)

⚙️ Usage
Train the Model (if not already trained):

Use scripts in the model/ directory to train the Random Forest classifier on your dataset.

Run the Detection & Prevention System:

bash
python main.py

or

bash
python mainauto.py
Monitor Logs:

Check prevention_log.txt for details of detected and prevented ransomware activity.

📊 How It Works
Feature Extraction:
Extracts relevant features from system activity and files.

Model Prediction:
The Random Forest model classifies activity as benign or ransomware.

Automated Response:
If ransomware is detected, the system takes preventive measures (e.g., stops process, quarantines files).

📁 Datasets
Place your training/testing datasets in the data/ directory.

Example datasets: File metadata, process logs, behavioral features, etc.
